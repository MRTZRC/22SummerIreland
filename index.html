			<h1>Course Information</h1>

			<p><strong>Course Description:</strong> Students will investigate 3D modeling and animation with an emphasis on principles. The skills and workflows that students learn within this class can be transferred to other software used within the industry with minor differences. This is a project-based course where students will be completing projects to show that they have mastery of the provided learning objectives. By the end of the class, students will be able to design and create unique 3D environments with animations!</p>

			<p><strong>Course Objectives:</strong> Below, you will find the objectives for this 7-module course. Each module overview and assessment tool will have a list of objectives that are aligned with the course objectives listed below. Students will be able to achieve and effectively demonstrate the following by the end of the semester:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Cooperative and collaborative teamwork with their peers</li>
				<li>Design principles and processes of 3D environments</li>
				<li>Manipulation and control over 3D digital objects, textures, lighting, and cameras</li>
				<li>Simulation tools to add more realism to 3D environments</li>
				<li>Natural movements and animation sequencing to tell a story</li>
				<li>Rendering principles to produce high quality rendered images</li>
			</ol>

			<p><strong>Course Modality:</strong> This course is offered in an asynchronous online format, meaning that the course will not meet at a scheduled time. If there is ever a need to meet for the course, we will meet through Zoom or other online collaborative tools. All materials and information needed to complete the assessments will be given through the required textbook or online in Canvas so it is expected that students participate in all course activities, demonstrations, and collaborations while following guidelines set out by the College and University to maintain safety and social distancing (for those of you living on/near campus). The schedule of an academic week in this course is from Mondays to Sundays; meaning that the start of any module will be on a Monday and will end on a Sunday. This gives the weekends to accommodate anyone's needs and schedules.</p>

			<p><strong>Special COVID-19 Statement - Spring 2022:</strong> As stated before, this course is currently offered asynchronous-online, so there isn't much concern here. For those who live on/near campus, you are expected to adhere to all University, City, and State policies governing social distancing, and safety precautions (such as the use of Personal Protection Equipment). If you are experiencing any symptoms of COVID, the flu, or another communicable disease, please do not come to my office/campus and seek medical assistance. If you receive a positive COVID-19 test result, refer to the COVID-19 section at the bottom of the syllabus. We will hope for the best. Be safe, make good decisions, stay healthy.</p>

			<p><strong>Final Schedule:</strong> Since this is an online course, the 4-part final project for this class will act as your final. The last two parts of your final project for Spring 2022 are due on <strong>Thursday, May 13th at 11:59 PM CST</strong>. Travel or moving plans that interfere with your completion of the final are not considered acceptable excuses for failure to be present or otherwise complete the final.</p>

			<h1>Course Policies</h1>

			<p><strong>General Policy:</strong> This is an online class, but not a self-paced class. That being said, students are required to read through, watch, and complete the given materials on time. There are many students in this class, and there is only one of me, so I encourage you to ask your peers questions using the current module's question discussion form. Each module will have a discussion zone specifically for you to ask questions over that specific module. If you are still having problems figuring out an answer to your question and the LST has not responded to your question in the discussion zone, please contact the LST via email. If you ever feel as though you do not understand something that is covered in the class, falling behind, or an emergency comes up, contact the LST immediately when the situation arises so that two things can happen: we can schedule an appointment to meet online or in-person, and we will be able to be more lenient on grading. If you have any disabilities, please go to the bottom of the syllabus to read about what you need to do then.</p>

			<p><strong>Inclusive Environment and Respect:</strong> It is of principle importance that the faculty, and supporting staff of this course foster an inclusive educational environment for all students to thrive. This means an active process of inclusion. Disrespect and discrimination of any kind are not tolerated. The instructor of this course pledges to provide to the best of their ability an inclusive course with appropriate materials that meets the needs of all students, while also engaging and representing voices, perspectives, and experiences of diverse and underrepresented backgrounds. As is the case with the Faculty and student support team, all students are expected to be facilitators of this practice and principle. In the event that students utilize a collaborative tool outside the scope of this course, it is expected that faculty, staff, and students alike follow these policies regardless of platform. It is important that any breach of this behavior by a student be reported to the course instructor, and the director of the IT Program as soon as possible.</p>

			<p><strong>Class Netiquette, Civility, and How to be Successful in an Online Course:</strong> Your instructor and fellow students wish to foster a safe online learning environment. All opinions and experiences, no matter how different or controversial they may be perceived, must be respected in the tolerant spirit of academic discourse. You are encouraged to comment, question, or critique an idea but you are not to attack an individual. Our differences, some of which are outlined in the University’s nondiscrimination statement, will add richness to this learning experience. Please consider that sarcasm and humor can be misconstrued in online interactions and generate unintended disruptions. Working as a community of learners, we can build a polite and respectful course ambiance. You will be expected to participate in online activities. Online etiquette should match your expected experience in a classroom - be kind to one another, and clearly outline your position on topics when posting on the discussion boards. It is challenging to say the least to facilitate meaningful online discussions through board postings and comments, so you will be holding recorded Zoom meetings with your small groups where you will discuss the necessary topics; it is our expectation that you put forth the time and effort to provide meaningful thoughts, feedback, and comments to your classmates when instructed to do so. The more you put in, the more you will get out of the experience. We know this is difficult to do, as schedules can be all over the place, however, I am confident that you and your peers will be able to find a 15 to 45-minute window in the 10,080 minutes in a week. That said, be appropriate, be considerate, and put forth measurable effort when commenting with your peers. It is our expectation that language and tone match the classroom and professionalism. If problems persist with an individual, or individuals, within a group, contact the LST so we can discuss a solution even if it means voting the person, or people, out of the group.</p>

			<p><strong>Contacting Learning Support Team:</strong> The lead instructor for the course, other IT Program instructors, and all other individuals associated with the grading and administration of this course are considered the Learning Support Team (LST). While the lead instructor will facilitate class, it may be that associated instructors within our program will provide specific support to concepts and practices covered in this course. To ensure that your questions are answered in a timely manner and with the greatest accuracy, it is important that all correspondence with the LST denote the subject of the inquiry in the subject line of the email.</p>

			<p>Please be as concise as possible with your questions, and reference the material that you are seeking assistance with; we just don’t want to send back a <a class="icon-link" href="https://www.lmgtfy.com/" title="Let Me Google That For You" target="_blank">Let Me Google That For You</a> link. Cite the exact problem that you are having, and list what steps you’ve already taken to solve the problem. The Learning Support Team is here to help, but we’re not here to simply do. Let us know that you’ve done some research, that you’re struggling with the specific topic, and let us know how we can be of assistance. Additionally, as the LST supports a range of online courses, please also be sure to identify yourself, the class, and the section that you are enrolled in. Email communications with us should mimic that of future employers; might as well get used to it now. We look forward to supporting your academic development here. The template below will help you get started with sending an email:</p>

			<p><strong>!Email Template!</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>The email should be addressed to the instructor:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>To: tompkinsmr@missouri.edu</li>
					<li>CC: [Other LST Members Here]</li>
				</ul>
				<li>The subject line should include the following text:</li>
				<ul>
					<li>INFOTC 2620 - "Assignment Name/Discussion Name/General Question"</li>
					<li>Replace what is in the quotes with the necessary information</li>
					<li>If you don't include this in your email's subject line, your email could go unread or make it that much more difficult to get back to you in a timely fashion!</li>
				</ul>
				<li>When addressing me, your instructor, please refer to me as Michael, Mr. Tompkins, or Professor Tompkins.</li>
				<li>The body of your email should include your first and last name along with a detailed explanation of why you are reaching out to us.</li>
				<li><a class="icon-link" href="mailto:tompkinsmr@missouri.edu?subject=INFOTC 2620 - [Replace this]&body=Hello Professor Tompkins,&cc=pjmddc@mail.missouri.edu">Automatic Email Template</a></li>
			</ul>

			<p>The LST will also do its best to get back to your inquiries as quickly as possible; ideally never more than 24 hours on any given request. Note that emails and other communications operate during typical business hours; Mondays through Fridays from 8:00 AM CST to 6:00 PM CST. Any emails or other forms of communication received after 6:00 PM CST will be addressed the following morning, and any emails received between 6:00 PM CST on Friday and 7:00 AM CST on Monday may have a longer delay period to receive a response.</p>

			<p>I will inform you via Canvas and email if I, or any other LST member, should have any health issues or be out of reach for any period of time. If you have a general question related to the course, you should post it in that specific module’s “Module Question” discussion board because someone else may have the same question or may be able to answer it sooner.</p>

			<p><strong>Other Communication:</strong> You will be placed in smaller groups for the semester to complete work where communication with your group is needed and expected. Within Canvas, there are tools to aid in communicating with your group.</p>

			<p>I will also use Zoom as a means to communicate with you online. Zoom is our "new, easy to use audio and web conferencing tool that offers screen sharing, group messaging, accessibility features, and access from mobile devices." If this will be your first time using Zoom, please be sure to visit <a class="icon-link" href="https://doit.missouri.edu/services/communications-collaboration/audio-web-conferencing/" title="DoIT's Support Page" target="_blank">DoIT's support website</a> and follow their "Getting Started" instructions. Discord is a free communication software that allows for more of a community conversation style.</p>

			<p><strong>Student Expectations:</strong> It is our mission to provide each student with the most meaningful, engaging learning environment possible. The Learning Support Team will do everything that we can to facilitate the highest quality experience directly, and indirectly. That said, this is a collaborative AND cooperative process, that requires the student to participate as well:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Always put forth your best effort and be responsible for your work</li>
				<li>Give yourself the appropriate amount of time to complete work for this course</li>
				<li>Always reach out to your Learning Support Team for assistance when needed</li>
				<li>Creativity is greatly encouraged - find the path that represents you</li>
				<li>Research your questions prior to reaching out to the LST; we’re not Google</li>
				<li>Engage with the material, the instructor, and with your fellow classmates</li>
				<li>Enjoy the process and discover what you can - college doesn’t last forever</li>
				<li>Explore</li>
			</ul>

			<p><strong>Course Point Breakdown:</strong> Though I aim to have 1080 total points in the class, some modifications may be necessary. Detailed instructions will be given for each activity. Some activities will require students to work with one another in both collaborative and cooperative ways. We understand the complication of schedules and responsibilities, especially in an online format, so make sure that you communicate your schedule with your team. If there are conflicts within your group, please try to resolve them reasonably between yourselves, and if problems persist, contact the LST immediately. As mentioned earlier, individuals that persistently cause problems may be voted out of the group resulting in a change of assessments.</p>

			<p>I will always demonstrate what is expected for each activity through detailed instructions. To receive an A or B grade the student must show excellence in the execution of concepts and theories, use of software, and quality of the projects. This is detailed in the rubric for each assignment. It takes time and effort to create quality. The instructor is available to help when an appointment is set up; however, there will not be “on-the-spot grading” permitted.</p>

			<p>It is our goal to provide feedback on all assessments within fourteen days of their submission date. Please note that various elements throughout the semester may interfere with our ability to achieve this goal. Feedback will always be provided through Canvas on the graded assignment pages, as line-item comments on the rubric. Please be patient with the LST as they work through grading; accuracy and feedback are important to us.</p>

			<p><strong>Late Policy:</strong> If an activity isn't submitted by the due date and time, Canvas will automatically mark the activity as a zero. You can submit an activity after the required time up to three days after the initial due date (72 hours). Every day that the assessment is late, your grade will be reduced by 25% <strong>before</strong> any additional points are removed from your grade due to errors. The exception to this late policy is the Final Project. The Final Project will <strong>NOT BE ACCEPTED</strong> after the listed due date and time (Thursday, May 12th at 11:59 PM CST), so please make sure you are diligent when completing your course work.</p>

			<p>That being said, I know that Canvas can cause problems with submissions sometimes. I account for this with a 15-minute window of time from when an assignment is due to your submission time. This means that if you are a second, a minute, or up to 15 minutes late for an assignment, the LST should NOT receive an email from you. If you do experience an issue with submitting to Canvas, please take screenshots of your problem to document it, add the screenshots to the folder with your project, zip the entire file, and share it with the LST via <a class="icon-link" href="https://onedrive.live.com/about/en-us/signin/" title="Microsoft One Drive" target="_blank">Microsoft One Drive</a>. Make sure that the shared file is visible to anyone with the link otherwise it will be a zero.</p>

			<p>The Late Policy will be described using a tiered system. Tier one is an assignment being late within 24 hours of the original submission time, tier two is an assignment being late within 48 hours of the original submission time, tier three is an assignment being late within 72 hours of the original time, and tier four is an assignment being later than 72 hours of the original time. The example table below demonstrates the tiered late system.</p>

			<p><strong>Grade Contesting:</strong> You will have <i>7 days</i> after each assessment's grade has been released to discuss, verify, and/or argue lost points. After that time has passed, you may not ask for a review of those particular assessments and if you do, I will refer back to this part of the syllabus. The only exception to this policy is the final project that is due during finals week. You will have from the time grades are released, until Monday, May 16, 2022, at 5:00 PM CST to discuss, verify, and/or argue lost points for the final project. Your grade will be set in stone as of Monday, May 16, 2022, at 5:01 PM CST, <strong>NO EXCEPTIONS</strong>.</p>

			<p>In all cases, only a doctor’s note, or other significant family dilemmas <strong>with documentation</strong> will circumvent this policy. However, you must inform the instructor about this by emailing directly, and within a reasonable amount of time as mentioned above. The instructor will confirm that the extension is granted. We cannot stress enough the importance of reaching out to faculty, and programmatic advisers (in the case of Information Technology, Sandra Brown) if there is an issue that’s preventing you from being successful in this, and other courses. Last-minute notifications of semester-long issues rarely work as excuses for lost points. Documentation is vital.</p>

			<p><strong>Grading Scale:</strong> Grades are based on the total points earned divided by the total possible points available in the course. The percent cutoffs are as follows:</p>

			<p>At the end of the semester, grades will <strong>NOT</strong> be rounded or curved at all! Please work diligently on all of the projects and follow the rubrics and grading guidelines for each activity. I have built-in extra credit into each of the Modules of the course to help you "round a grade up", but these extra credit opportunities can be very challenging and no support will be given towards these extra credit assessments.</p>

			<h1>Additional Course Policies</h1>
			<p><strong>University Policies:</strong></p>
			<p>Additional details on the following University of Missouri policies can be located by selecting the course navigation item to the left labeled "Support & Policies".</p>

			<p><strong>Statement for Mental Health:</strong></p>
			<p>The University of Missouri is committed to supporting student well-being through an integrated network of care, with a wide range of services to help students succeed. The MU Counseling Center offers professional mental health care and can help you find the best approach to treatment based on your needs. Call to make an appointment at 573-882-6601. Any student in crisis may call or go to the MU Counseling Center between 8:00 – 5:00 M-F. After-hours phone support is available at 573-882-6601. Visit our website at <a class="icon-link" href="https://wellbeing.missouri.edu" title="The University of Missouri Wellness Center" target="_blank">https://wellbeing.missouri.edu</a> to take an online mental health screening, find out about workshops and resources that can help you thrive, or learn how to support a friend. Download Sanvello, a phone app that teaches skills and strategies to help you maintain good mental health. Log in with your Mizzou e-mail to unlock all the tools available through Sanvello at no cost to you.</p>

			<p><strong>Students with Disabilities:</strong></p>
			<p>The goal of the University of Missouri is to ensure an inclusive learning environment for all students. <a class="icon-link" href="https://disabilitycenter.missouri.edu/" title="The University of Missouri Disability Center">The University of Missouri Disability Center</a> provides services and accommodations for students to participate fully in the learning experience and to experience equitable evaluation of their performance. Students (including online students) with a documented disability can contact the Disability Center to establish an <a class="icon-link" href="https://disabilitycenter.missouri.edu/accommodations-and-supports/" title="Accomodation Plan" target="_blank">accommodation plan</a>. Documented disabilities include hearing, vision, mobility, learning and attention, psychological health, and physical health. Students’ accommodations are implemented with the input of students to maximize the learning experiences. The MU Disability Center keeps information about a student’s disability confidential. Please notify me of your eligibility for accommodations as soon as possible. Additionally, if there are aspects of the course that present as barriers, such as inaccessible course content (e.g., learning assessments, PowerPoints, non-captioned videos, images, tables, PDFs) or if you need an immediate accommodation due to an injury, please contact me or the Disability Center as soon as possible. </p>

			<p><strong>Decreasing the Risk of COVID-19 in Classrooms and Labs:</strong></p>
			<p>If you have tested positive for COVID-19 or have been identified as someone who needs to quarantine, do not attend class in person until the mandated period for isolation or quarantine has passed. Your instructor will work with you on arrangements to access class material while you are in isolation or quarantine.</p>
			<p>Additionally, if you are experiencing any COVID-related symptoms, or are otherwise feeling unwell, do not attend in-person classes and contact your health care provider and/or student health immediately. COVID symptoms include: fever greater than 100.4 or chills; cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing; fatigue; unexplained muscle or body aches; headache; new loss of taste or smell; sore throat; congestion or runny nose; nausea or vomiting; diarrhea.</p>
			<p>Instructors or students with concerns about how a student is following any University-mandated COVID-19 policies and protocols should report those concerns to the Office of the Dean of Students. Concerns can be documented on a <a class="icon-link" href="https://cm.maxient.com/reportingform.php?UnivofMissouriSystem&layout_id=38" title="COVID Safety Measures Reporting Form" target="_blank">COVID Safety Measures Reporting Form</a>.</p>
			<p>Please note that sub-groups of students may have specific needs during COVID or online learning. One group is international students, who may be participating in class from their home countries and in different time zones. The instructor may be able to make reasonable accommodations to support the success of international students currently living in time zones that differ significantly from that of Columbia, MO. International students are expected to consult with their instructor about possible accommodations as soon as possible after the start of the course.</p>
			<p>Please consult <a class="icon-link" href="https://renewal.missouri.edu/" title="Show Me Renewal" target="_blank">Show Me Renewal</a> for further guidelines. This statement will be updated as information changes.</p>

			<p><strong>Academic Integrity:</strong></p>
			<p>Academic integrity is fundamental to the activities and principles of a university. All members of the academic community must be confident that each person’s work has been responsibly and honorably acquired, developed, and presented. Any effort to gain an advantage not given to all students is dishonest whether or not the effort is successful. The academic community regards breaches of the academic integrity rules as extremely serious matters. Sanctions for such a breach may include academic sanctions from the instructor, including failing the course for any violation, to disciplinary sanctions ranging from probation to expulsion. When in doubt about plagiarism, paraphrasing, quoting, collaboration, or any other form of cheating, consult the course instructor or the <a class="icon-link" href="https://oai.missouri.edu/" title="Office of Academic Integrity" target="_blank">Office of Academic Integrity</a>.</p>
			<p>Students are expected to adhere to this honor pledge on all graded work whether or not they are explicitly asked in advance to do so: “I strive to uphold the University values of respect, responsibility, discovery, and excellence. On my honor, I pledge that I have neither given nor received unauthorized assistance on this work.”</p>

			<p><strong>Intellectual Pluralism:</strong></p>
			<p>The University community welcomes intellectual diversity and respects student rights. Students who have questions or concerns regarding the atmosphere in this class (including respect for diverse opinions) may contact the departmental chair or divisional director, the Office of <a class="icon-link" href="https://oai.missouri.edu/about/intellectual-pluralism/" title="Academic Integrity" target="_blank">Academic Integrity</a>, or the <a class="icon-link" href="http://equity.missouri.edu/" title="MU Equity Office" target="_blank">MU Equity Office</a>.</p>

			<p><strong>Statement for Executive Order #38, Academic Inquiry, Course Discussion, and Privacy:</strong></p>
			<p>When students record something that happens in a course (a lecture, class discussions, meetings, etc.) it has an impact on the rights of the people captured in that recording. For example, the instructor and the University may have rights to the intellectual property contained in that recording. At the same time, another student who may have been recorded has the right to privacy. In order to protect these rights, MU employs a policy (called <a class="icon-link" href="https://www.umsystem.edu/ums/rules/collected_rules/programs/ch200/200.015_academic_inquiry_course_discussion_and_privacy" title="Executive Order No. 38" target="_blank">“Executive Order No. 38”</a>) to govern both situations you may encounter while taking a course – when an instructor allows recordings and when they do not.</p>
			<p>Instructors should inform students which applies to their course:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>In this class, students may not make audio or video recordings of course activity, except students permitted to record as an accommodation under <a class="icon-link" href="http://www.umsystem.edu/ums/rules/collected_rules/programs/ch240/240.040_policy_related_to_students_with_disabilities" title="Section 240.040 of the Collected Rules and Regulations of the University of Missouri" target="_blank">section 240.040 of the Collected Rules and Regulations of the University of Missouri</a>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Students who violate this policy are subject to discipline in accordance with provisions of <a class="icon-link" href="http://www.umsystem.edu/ums/rules/collected_rules/programs/ch200/200.020_rules_of_procedures_in_student_conduct_matters" title="Section 200.020 of the Collected Rules and Regulations of the University of Missouri" target="_blank">Section 200.020 of the Collected Rules and Regulations of the University of Missouri</a> pertaining to student conduct matters.</p>

			<p><strong>FERPA:</strong></p>
			<p>The <a class="icon-link" href="https://registrar.missouri.edu/policies-procedures/ferpa/" title="Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)" target="_blank">Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)</a> of 1974 is a federal law designed to protect the privacy of educational records, to establish the rights of students to inspect and review their education records, and to provide guidelines for the correction of inaccurate and misleading data through informal and formal hearings. The law applies to any individual who is or has been in attendance at an institution and regarding whom the institution maintains educational records. Once students have matriculated to the University of Missouri, i.e. enrolled in course work, FERPA rights transfer to the student, regardless of the student’s age.</p>
			<p>Students can enable certain individuals to have access to their education records by signing a <a class="icon-link" href="https://registrar.missouri.edu/policies-procedures/ferpa/" title="FERPA waiver" target="_blank">FERPA waiver</a>. The consent must specify records to be disclosed, state the purpose of the disclosure and identify the party or class of parties to whom the disclosure must be made.</p>

			<p><strong>Religious Holidays & Accommodations:</strong></p>
			<p>Many religious faiths are represented in the student body. The University of Missouri does not restrict student free exercise of religion, unless 1) the restriction is in the form of a rule of general applicability, and does not discriminate against religion or among religions, and 2) it can be demonstrated that the application of the restriction is essential to furthering a compelling university interest, and is not unduly restrictive considering the relevant circumstance. The policy of the University attempts to strike a reasonable balance between accommodating the religious practice of students and meeting academic needs and standards.</p>
			<p>Consult IDE’s <a class="icon-link" href="https://diversity.missouri.edu/guide-to-religions/" title="Guide to Religions" target="_blank">Guide to Religions</a> for the form that can be used to notify an instructor of an absence associated with religious practice. Students are expected to notify their instructor(s) by completing and submitting this form in a manner that is consistent with the procedure outlined in the university’s policy on student religious accommodation. Providing false information regarding sincerely held religious practice is a violation of the university’s Standard of Conduct and will not be tolerated.</p>
